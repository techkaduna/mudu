# WELCOME TO mudu

**mudu** is a package for units and dimension handling, unit conversion
and unit arithemtic, with support for custom units definition.

**mudu** was created as part of a larger project (my final year
project), [flightperformance]{.title-ref}, which is a Python package for
analyzing aircraft (fixed wing) performance. As it is standard in
engineering to specify the units of data so as to ensure dimensional
homogeniety and reproducability, the [flightperformance]{.title-ref}
package required a means of specifying the units of data, the quantity
they represents, convert between units and do arithemtic operations
efforlessly with emphasis on flexibiliy and readability, this is what
mudu does.

**mudu** provides a set of classes and methods, while retaining
Python\'s expressiveness, to add unit signatures to numeric data,
convert between units and perform valid arithemtic operations on
dimension (or quantities) and unit objects. At its core, mudu creates
dimensions using the [DimensionUnitBase]{.title-ref} base class while
units are all instances or child classes of the [\_UnitType]{.title-ref}
class, both these classes are composed of other classes.

## Why use **mudu**

> -   It provides an simple and expressive way of specifying units
> -   Capability to perform conversion from one unit to another while
>     ensuring dimensional homogeniety as it applies in mathematics
> -   Supports valid arithemtic operations on
>     [\_DimensionUnitBase]{.title-ref} child objects and
>     [\_UnitType]{.title-ref} objects
> -   It provides interfaces to define custom units, dimensions ( or
>     quantities) and define relationships between custom units and
>     existing units

This documentation, contains information about the general structure of
mudu, a quick tutorial that captures almost all the important
functionalities of mudu and some selected examples to give to an easy
start on the usage of the package.

## Installation

To install using pip, run:

> ``` shell
> $ pip install mudu
